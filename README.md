# Contact-Manager

Address book inspired Contact Manager application designed to manage personal and professional contacts. Registration and login are 
implemented using the JSON web token, bcryptjs, and express-validator for user verification and protecting user information. Express-
validator implements protected routes preventing other users from seeing their account. The useContext API is implemented for state management
for a full CRUD application.
